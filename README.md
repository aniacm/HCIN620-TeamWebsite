# General Information of Project
### Project Name
Food Wastage (Current)
### Stakeholders
1. People working in Dinning Service
2. People in need of food (eg. RIT Foodshare on FB)

# Week 3 - Milestone 1

## Problems

We are going to choose a topic from four possible ideas.

### PLAN A. Food Wastage

We found that everyday there is a huge food wastage on campus dinning service, so we hope that we can reduce that wastage and share the extra food to people who need it.

The flow of Food Share: Producing -> Collecting -> Transport -> Distribution

The stakeholders: 1. People working in Dinning Service  2. People in need of food (eg. RIT Foodshare on FB)

The keypoint of the project: 
1. Avoid Misuse
2. Food Quality
3. Personal Verifiction ( NGO/ QR-code/ Passport/ Driver Lisence )

### PLAN B. Airline Transportaion

When taking a long trip, the precise information of airline is one of the most significant thing people would like to know. However, even some of the customer service of the airplane company do not know the exact information and might misguide customers.

The keypoint information:
1. Fast entrance which can apply online
2. Terminal information (eg. Transfer from different terminal)
3. Luggage weight of different flight

## Solutions

After discussion, we agree to start to focus on Food Wastage as Plan A, and if the project doesn't go well, we will switch to the Airline Transportaion as Plan B.
