# FoodShare

### Description
We found that everyday there is a huge food wastage on campus dining service, so we hope that we can reduce that wastage and share the leftover food to people who need it.

The flow of Food Share: Producing -> Collecting -> Transport -> Distribution

### Stakeholders
1. Staffs and managers working in Dining Service
2. People in need of food (eg. Churches, NGOs or people who cannot afford the food)
3. Volunteers who collect and deliver the food

# Week 3 - Milestone 1 Project Focus

## Problem

Lack of the basic information about Recovery Rochester organization and their workflow:
1. The type and quality of leftover food they collect;
2. Distribution time and spots;
3. Transportation routes and storage;
4. How volunteers communicate with each other and staff of cafe

## Solution

1. Do the contextual inquiry

Observe the staff cooks when they deal with the leftover food;
Interview the cafe managers about their willingness;
Interview the people at RIT Foodshare and Recovery Rochester about the process of collecting and distributing food.

2. Evaluate the feasibility of the project and Decide the topics we are going to work on

Analyze whether the stakeholders are available to do more research based on the result of inquiry.
Switch to the Airline Transportation as Plan B if Plan A doesn't go well.
(PLAN B - Airline Transportation)

## Conclusion
We have decide to focus on Food Share to be our project. And we are going to do more interviews for volunteers of Recovery Rochester and managers of cafes in order to find out the design requirements.
