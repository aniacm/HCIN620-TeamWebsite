# FoodShare

### Description
We found that everyday there is a huge food wastage on campus dinning service, so we hope that we can reduce that wastage and share the leftover food to people who need it.

The flow of Food Share: Producing -> Collecting -> Transport -> Distribution

### Stakeholders
1. Staffs and managers working in Dinning Service
2. People in need of food (eg. followers of RIT Foodshare on FB)

### Potential Problems
1. The type and quality of leftover food;
2. Distribution time and spots;
3. Transportation routes and storage;
4. Less students buying food from the cafe; 
5. Limitation on amount of free food for one person

# Week 3 - Milestone 1

## Problems

Lack of the basic information about restaurants and their workflow.

## Solution

1. Do the contextual inquiry

Observe the staff cooks when they deal with the leftover food;
Interview the cafe managers about their willingness;
Interview the people at RIT Foodshare about the process of collecting and distributing food.

2. Evaluate the feasibility of the project 

Analyze whether the stakeholders are available to do more research based on the result of inquiry.

3. Decide the topics we are going to work on

Switch to the Airline Transportaion as Plan B if Plan A doesn't go well.

### PLAN B - Airline Transportation

When taking a long trip, the precise information of transportation is one of the most significant thing people would like to know. However, even some of the customer service of the airplane companies do not know the exact information and might misguide customers.

The keypoint information:
1. Fast entrance which can apply online
2. Terminal information (eg. Transfer from different terminal)
3. Luggage weight of different flight
